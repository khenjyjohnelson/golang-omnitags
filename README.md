## Overview

This project is a backend service written in Go. It is designed to manage basis data and provide a RESTful API interface. The documentation covers installation, configuration, and route details.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.15+ recommended)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/khenjyjohnelson/golang-omnitags.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd /Users/ariebrainware/go/src/github.com/khenjyjohnelson/golang-omnitags
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   go mod download
   ```

### Configuration

- Create and configure any necessary environment variables. For example, a `.env` file can be used to set database connections and server ports.
- Sample environment variables:
  ```
    APPNAME=ltt-be
    APITOKEN=ed25519key
    APPENV=local
    APPPORT=19091
    GINMODE=debug
    DBHOST=localhost
    DBPORT=3306
    DBNAME=databasename
    DBUSER=databaseuser
    DBPASS=databasepassword
  ```

### Build and Run

- To build the project, use:
  ```
  go build -o basisdata
  ```
- To run the service, use:
  ```
  ./basisdata
  ```
- During development, you can simply run:
  ```
  go run main.go
  ```

## Routes

Below is an outline of the REST API endpoints provided:

### GET /

- **Description:** Health check or landing route.
- **Response:** Simple status message confirming the service is operational.

### GET /api/resource

- **Description:** Retrieve a list of resources.
- **Response:** JSON array of resources.

### POST /api/resource

- **Description:** Create a new resource.
- **Request Body:** JSON payload with resource details.
- **Response:** JSON object of the newly created resource.

### PUT /api/resource/{id}

- **Description:** Update an existing resource.
- **Path Parameter:** `id` of the resource to update.
- **Request Body:** JSON payload with updated resource details.
- **Response:** JSON object of the updated resource.

### DELETE /api/resource/{id}

- **Path Parameter:** `id` of the resource to delete.
- **Response:** JSON message confirming deletion.

## Functionality

### Data Management

The primary functionality revolves around creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) resources in the database. This includes:

- Validating input data.
- Managing database transactions.
- Returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

### Error Handling

- The project uses proper error handling middleware to capture and log errors.
- Returns structured JSON error responses with helpful error messages.

### Middleware

- Logging: Request and response logging.
- Authentication & Authorization: Secure certain routes based on user roles (if applicable).

### Testing

- Include unit and integration tests to cover API endpoint behaviors.
- Use Go's built-in testing framework:
  ```
  go test ./...
  ```
